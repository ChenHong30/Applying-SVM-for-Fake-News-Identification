# Applying SVM for Fake News Identification

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify and classify fake news. It includes two main notebooks:

- `Machine Learning - Compared Models.ipynb`: This notebook compares various machine learning models to determine the most effective one for fake news identification.
- `Machine Learning - SVM Model.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on using the SVM model for the identification and classification of fake news.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes news articles from various sources, which have been pre-labeled as "true" or "fake."

- Dataset file: `Dataset.rar`

## Quick Start
To run these notebooks, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
